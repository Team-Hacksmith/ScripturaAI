**Algorithm**

The code implements a class `Graph` that represents an undirected graph.
The graph is represented as a dictionary of vertices, where each vertex is a key and the value is a list of the vertices that are adjacent to it.

The class has the following methods:

* `add_vertex(self, vertex)`: Adds a new vertex to the graph.
* `add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2)`: Adds a new edge to the graph between two vertices.
* `remove_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2)`: Removes an edge from the graph between two vertices.
* `remove_vertex(self, vertex)`: Removes a vertex from the graph.
* `display(self)`: Displays the graph.

**How the code works**

The following is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The `Graph` class is defined with a constructor that initializes the graph to an empty dictionary.
2. The `add_vertex` method is defined to add a new vertex to the graph. If the vertex is already in the graph, it prints a message indicating that the vertex already exists.
3. The `add_edge` method is defined to add a new edge to the graph between two vertices. If either of the vertices is not in the graph, it prints a message indicating that one or both vertices were not found.
4. The `remove_edge` method is defined to remove an edge from the graph between two vertices. If either of the vertices is not in the graph, it prints a message indicating that one or both vertices were not found.
5. The `remove_vertex` method is defined to remove a vertex from the graph. If the vertex is not in the graph, it prints a message indicating that the vertex was not found.
6. The `display` method is defined to display the graph. It iterates over the vertices in the graph and prints each vertex along with its adjacent vertices.

**Output**

The following is the output of the code:

```
A: [B, C]
B: [A, C]
C: [A, B]
A: [B]
C: [A]
```
