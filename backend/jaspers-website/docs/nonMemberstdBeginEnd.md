# C++ Code Analysis: Displaying Elements of Different Containers

## Overview

This C++ code demonstrates how to create a generic function for displaying the elements of various standard containers, such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, and `std::array`, using the non-member functions `std::begin` and `std::end`. These functions allow iteration over different container types without being tied to a specific container implementation.

## Code Breakdown

### Included Libraries

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
```

- `#include <array>`: Includes the standard array container.
- `#include <iostream>`: Includes input/output stream library for console output.
- `#include <list>`: Includes the standard list container.
- `#include <vector>`: Includes the standard vector container.

### Function Template: `displayElement`

```cpp
template <typename Container>
void displayElement(const Container &cont)
{
    for (auto it = std::begin(cont); it != std::end(cont); it++)
        std::cout << *it << " ";

    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

- This is a templated function that takes a container of any type.
- It uses a range-based `for` loop to iterate through the container.
- `std::begin(cont)` and `std::end(cont)` are used to obtain iterators to the beginning and end of the container, respectively.
- Each element is dereferenced and printed to the console followed by a space.
- Finally, a newline is printed after all elements have been displayed.

### `main` Function

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::list<int> lst{6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    std::array<int, 5> arr{11, 12, 13, 14, 15};

    std::cout << "Vector Elements: ";
    displayElement(vec);

    std::cout << "List elements: ";
    displayElement(lst);

    std::cout << "Array elements: ";
    displayElement(arr);
}
```

- The `main` function defines three different containers:
  - A `std::vector` of integers containing values from 1 to 5.
  - A `std::list` of integers containing values from 6 to 10.
  - A `std::array` of integers containing values from 11 to 15.
  
- For each container, the program calls the `displayElement` function to print the elements to the console.
- The output is prefixed with a descriptive message for clarity.

## Output

When this program is executed, the output will be:

```
Vector Elements: 1 2 3 4 5 
List elements: 6 7 8 9 10 
Array elements: 11 12 13 14 15 
```

## Conclusion

This code effectively demonstrates the usage of templates and the standard library functions `std::begin` and `std::end` to create a generic function for displaying elements of various container types in C++. The use of templates allows for code reuse and flexibility, making it easy to apply the same function to different data structures.
