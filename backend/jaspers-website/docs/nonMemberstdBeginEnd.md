# C++ Code Analysis

## Overview

This C++ code demonstrates the use of generic programming with containers in C++. It includes functions to display elements from various container types using `std::begin` and `std::end`, which are non-member functions that work with all standard containers.

## Code Breakdown

### Includes

The code includes the following standard library headers:

- `<array>`: For using `std::array`.
- `<iostream>`: For input and output operations.
- `<list>`: For using `std::list`.
- `<vector>`: For using `std::vector`.

### Function: `displayElement`

```cpp
template <typename Container>
void displayElement(const Container &cont)
{
    for (auto it = std::begin(cont); it != std::end(cont); it++)
        std::cout << *it << " ";

    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

- **Template Function**: `displayElement` is a template function that takes a container of any type (`Container`) as a parameter.
- **Iteration**: It uses a for-loop, iterating from the beginning to the end of the container using `std::begin` and `std::end`.
- **Output**: Each element is dereferenced and printed to the standard output, followed by a space.
- **New Line**: After all elements are printed, a newline is added for formatting.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::list<int> lst{6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    std::array<int, 5> arr{11, 12, 13, 14, 15};

    std::cout << "Vector Elements: ";
    displayElement(vec); // Calls displayElement for vector

    std::cout << "List elements: ";
    displayElement(lst); // Calls displayElement for list

    std::cout << "Array elements: ";
    displayElement(arr); // Calls displayElement for array
}
```

- **Container Initialization**: 
  - A `std::vector` named `vec` is initialized with integers from 1 to 5.
  - A `std::list` named `lst` is initialized with integers from 6 to 10.
  - A `std::array` named `arr` is initialized with integers from 11 to 15.
  
- **Function Calls**: 
  - The `displayElement` function is called three times, once for each container type (`vec`, `lst`, and `arr`), displaying their elements.

### Output

When the program is executed, it produces the following output:

```
Vector Elements: 1 2 3 4 5 
List elements: 6 7 8 9 10 
Array elements: 11 12 13 14 15 
```

## Key Points

- The code effectively demonstrates the use of generic programming in C++ through the use of templates and standard library containers.
- The use of `std::begin` and `std::end` enhances the flexibility of the `displayElement` function, allowing it to work with any standard container.
- This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.

## Conclusion

This C++ code is a simple yet effective example of using templates and standard library functions to work with different container types. It illustrates the power of generic programming in C++, enabling developers to write more versatile and reusable code.
