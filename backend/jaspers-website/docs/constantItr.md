# Code Analysis: C++ Vector Iteration Example

This C++ code demonstrates how to use iterators to traverse a `std::vector` containing integers. The code includes both constant and non-constant iterators to illustrate different ways of accessing elements within the vector.

## Code Breakdown

### Includes and Namespace

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```
- The program includes the `<iostream>` header for input and output operations and the `<vector>` header to utilize the `std::vector` container.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main()
{
```
- The `main` function serves as the entry point for the program.

### Vector Initialization

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers{1,2,3,4,5};
```
- A `std::vector` named `numbers` is initialized with five integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Constant Iterator Loop

```cpp
for(auto constantIterator = numbers.cbegin(); constantIterator != numbers.cend(); constantIterator++){
    std::cout << *constantIterator << " ";
}
std::cout << "\n";
```
- A constant iterator (`constantIterator`) is created using `cbegin()` to point to the first element of the vector.
- The loop iterates through the vector using this constant iterator, printing each element followed by a space.
- The loop continues until the iterator reaches the end of the vector (checked using `cend()`).
- After printing all elements, a newline character is printed for better formatting.

### Non-constant Iterator Access

```cpp
std::vector<int>::iterator i = numbers.begin();
std::cout << "Raw value of i: " << *i << std::endl;
```
- A non-constant iterator `i` is initialized to point to the first element of the vector using `begin()`.
- The value of the element pointed to by `i` is printed, demonstrating direct access to the vectorâ€™s elements without traversal.

### End of Main Function

```cpp
return 0;
}
```
- The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

## Summary

This code effectively demonstrates:
- How to initialize a vector and populate it with values.
- The use of constant and non-constant iterators to access and print elements of the vector.
- The difference between `cbegin()`/`cend()` for constant iterators and `begin()`/`end()` for non-constant iterators.
- Basic output using the `std::cout` stream.

The program serves as a simple yet effective introduction to working with vectors and iterators in C++.
