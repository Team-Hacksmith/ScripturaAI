# C++ Code Analysis

## Overview
This C++ code snippet demonstrates the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) `vector` to store a collection of integers. It then iterates through the vector using an iterator and prints each element to the console.

## Code Explanation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Initialize a vector containing integers
    std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    
    // Iterate through the vector using an iterator
    for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
        // Dereference the iterator to access the value and print it
        std::cout << *it << " ";
    }

    // Print a newline at the end
    std::cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Components

1. **Headers**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: Includes the Input/Output stream library for console operations.
   - `#include <vector>`: Includes the vector library to utilize the `std::vector` container.

2. **Main Function**:
   - The program starts execution from the `main` function.

3. **Vector Initialization**:
   - `std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};`: A vector called `numbers` is initialized with five integer values.

4. **Iterator Loop**:
   - `for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it)`: This loop begins with an iterator `it` set to the start of the vector and continues until the end of the vector is reached.
   - Inside the loop, `*it` dereferences the iterator to access the current element, which is then printed to the console.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - A space is printed after each number for better readability.

6. **End of Program**:
   - `std::cout << "\n";`: After printing all the numbers, a newline character is printed for better output formatting.
   - `return 0;`: Indicates successful program termination.

## Additional Notes
- **Non-modifying Elements**: The code does not modify the elements of the vector; it simply reads and prints them.
- **Forward Iteration**: The iterator only moves forward through the vector; it does not support backward movement in this implementation.

## Conclusion
This code snippet effectively demonstrates basic C++ STL usage for storing and iterating through a collection of integers. It provides a clear example of using iterators to access elements without modifying them, showcasing fundamental concepts in C++ programming.
