# Bank Management System Code Overview

This Python script implements a simple Bank Management System using the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `mysql.connector` for database interaction. The program allows users to register, log in, and perform various banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and deleting their accounts.

## Key Components

### Imports

```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector as my
import os
```

- **pandas**: Used for handling data in DataFrame format.
- **mysql.connector**: Used to connect and interact with a MySQL database.
- **os**: Used for clearing the console screen.

### Database Connection

```python
try:
    con = my.connect(host='localhost', user='root', passwd='', database='bank')
    cur = con.cursor()
except my.errors.DatabaseError:
    print('Server Connection Failed')
```

- Connects to a MySQL database named `bank`. If the connection fails, it prints an error message.

### Global Variables and Constants

```python
LENGTH = 30
loggeduserdata = pd.DataFrame([])
start = 'mainmenu'
```

- `LENGTH`: A constant used for formatting output.
- `loggeduserdata`: A DataFrame that holds information about the currently logged-in user.
- `start`: Controls the flow of the program by storing the current menu state.

### Functions

1. **heading_print(name)**: 
   - Displays a formatted heading and the name of the logged-in user if applicable.

2. **input_choice(msg)**: 
   - Prompts the user for input and returns the choice as an integer.

3. **enter_to_continue()**: 
   - Pauses the program for user readability.

4. **mainmenu()**: 
   - Displays the main menu and returns the user's choice.

5. **new_user_registration()**: 
   - Handles new user registration, including input collection and database insertion.

6. **login()**: 
   - Manages user login, checks credentials, and loads user data into the global DataFrame.

7. **personalbanking()**: 
   - Displays banking options available to logged-in users.

8. **show_balance()**: 
   - Displays the user's current balance.

9. **add_amnt(amt)**: 
   - Updates the user's balance in both the DataFrame and the database.

10. **dep_amnt()**: 
    - Handles the deposit of funds.

11. **wit_amnt()**: 
    - Manages fund withdrawal, checking for sufficient balance.

12. **logout()**: 
    - Logs the user out by clearing the `loggeduserdata`.

13. **del_acc()**: 
    - Deletes the user's account and associated data from the database.

### Main Loop

The program runs within a `while True` loop that listens to the `start` variable to determine which function to execute next based on the user's choices. The loop continues until the user selects the option to exit.

### User Interaction

Users can perform the following actions:

- Register as a new user.
- Log in to access their account.
- Conduct personal banking activities (check balance, deposit, withdraw, delete account).
- Log out of their account.
- Exit the program.

## Summary

This code provides a basic framework for a Bank Management System that allows users to manage their banking activities through a console interface. It integrates with a MySQL database to store user information securely and efficiently. The structure is modular, with clear separation of functionalities through defined functions, making it easy to understand and maintain.
